      <h2>Design Case Study:</h2>
      <h1>Blue Heron Healing Arts<h1>

      <img src="img/heronheader.jpg" alt="the new header image by itself, the blue heron on sunset and water">

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Blue Heron Healings Arts needed changes to their existing site, but their original creator could no longer help them make updates. With a low resolution header image that was beginning to show its age and a new web designer on board, we saw an opportunity to breathe fresh life into their visuals. However, their visitors depend on a simple and consistent site. We struck a balance between the new and the familiar to deliver a beautiful site update.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Small Changes Needed</h3>
      <p>Blue Heron Healing Arts is a healing center in Corvallis, OR that can offer a multitude of naturopathic and alternative treatments to its patients through its collective of practitioners and specialists. They had a website that had been created by a web designer and friend. The original information on the website remained constant for a long time, and the website did not require tending. However, when it came time to make updates, the original creator of the site had sustained a long term brain injury and could not remember how the site had been made. Piper, a practitioner at Blue Heron, approached me to make the required updates to the information on the site.</p>

      <p>The objective for the site was updated information. Piper allowed that I could also make design changes in order to gain more experience. The design goals that I set were to create a new header image at higher resolution, establish a font set that matched their mission and feeling, and replace their bullet points with thematically consistent ones. I wanted the site to feel fresh and timeless, but also familiar to those who used it often and not so drastically changed as to be uncomfortable. We agreed that the new site should be responsive to different screen sizes.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>One Piece at a Time</h3>
      <p>When Piper was first showing me the Blue Heron website, she smiled at the header image. "I love that heron," she said. The header in question featured a small blue heron standing in reeds in a setting sun landscape. The image is lovely; it imports a serenity that potential clients would be seeking in coming to their site. Unfortunately, the old header was beginning to run low on resolution and couldn't be scaled up. It was beginning to show its age on newer screens. It was also dark.</p>

      <p>I began work on a new header, concentrating on the elements in the old header that Piper loved: the heron, the sunset, and the watery landscape. I also looked to fix the problems found in the old header: an overall dark image that was lacking in resolution.</p>

      <p>Next, the fonts. The old fonts had inconsistent widths throughout the letters that made it difficult to read at smaller sizes, and all of their chosen fonts together didn't communicate a clear message or feeling. The site draws people often experiencing chronic issues, and the font needed to be easily read by people experiencing vision difficulties. I selected a new font that was readable and matched the Blue Heron feeling. I increased its size to make it easier to read and used it consistently throughout headers and paragraphs.</p>

      <p>For the bullet points, the old site used fleur de lis. These were distinctive, but didn't have anything to do with their practices. I created them a circular spiral, a motif common in healing practices, and made it in a color matching their fonts. This spiral is repeated in their new favicon, creating repetition and consistency in their site.</p>

      <p>The changes to color were minimal. Their existing colors, light and dark blue, were calming and iconic for their site. I kept their light blue background, changing it only to a solid color instead of a gradient so that text contrast would remain consistent throughout the entire page. I picked a new dark blue for their fonts and menus, using a blue found in the new header image.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Responsive and New. Familiar and Comfortable.</h3>

      <br>
      <h4>Before</h4>
      <img src="img/oldsite.jpg" alt="the old blue heron healing arts home page">
      <p>Calming color scheme, but inconsistent and difficult typography, low resolution header image and nonsensical bullet points.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>After</h4>
      <img src="img/newsite.jpg" alt="the new blue heron healing arts home page">
      <p>Familiar color scheme, high resolution header image, consistent and readable typography, and thematically consistent bullet points.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Setting the Mood</h4>
      <img src="img/heronheader.jpg" alt="the new header image by itself, the blue heron on sunset and water">
      <p>The new header, which largely features on every page and sets the tone for the healing center, keeps the important elements of the original header while being brighter and higher resolution.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Following a Theme</h4>
      <img src="img/fontbullet.png" alt="a close up of the font and bullet points">
      <p>A new font and matching bullet points communicates a consistent tone and is easier to read for visitors with vision difficulties.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>View Anywhere</h4>
      <img id="mobileview" src="img/responsive.png" alt="blue heron healing arts site in mobile dimensions">
      <p>The new site responds to screen dimensions and reads easily on any device.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Success from Small Changes</h3>
      <p>Piper and the rest of the practitioners at Blue Heron Healing Arts love the new site. It is perfect for their visitors' needs, communicates the feeling of peace and healing in every design choice, and contains all of the updated information that they needed on the site.</p>

      <p>Would Piper recommend my work to others? "Oh yes yes yes! I wanted you to hear the sound of our voices singing out our resounding yes!!! We love your work!"</p>
